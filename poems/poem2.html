      <p>
        Through the window, <br>
        To the moon,<br>
        A shine I fear to ever lose. <br> <br>

        From the darkness, <br>
        To the light, <br>
        You lit my world, made it bright. <br> <br>

        From strings of heart <br>
        To threads of life, <br>
        Your presence brings my soul delight. <br> <br>

        But moonless nights, <br>
        When you're away, <br>
        Steal my joy and blur the day. <br> <br>

        When you are gone, <br>
        When moonlight's drowned, <br>
        I want to cry— <br>
        I want to drown. <br>
