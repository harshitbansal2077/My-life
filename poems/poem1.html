      <p>
        Whats love? <br>
        I dont know <br>
        What is meant to be loved? <br>
        I dont know <br>
        What if i tell you i felt it? <br>
        You wont believe <br>
        But there is a feeling deep down me <br>
        Unexplored but someone took it and gave me this. <br>
        Meaning of love? <br>
        I cannot explain <br>
        Just wanting to be with you, my heart exclaimed <br>
        You took it and sewed it with yours <br>
        Making us one, forever with a cause <br>
        You took it what was mine <br>
        The trade of love and life <br>
        Whats love? <br>
        I dont know <br>
        But there is a feeling deep down me, yet unexplored <br>
        You went to the corner i forgot i had <br>
        You made me yours with nothing to be said <br>
        Your heart is mine <br>
        Mine you made yours <br>
        But i got this feeling <br>
        Yet unexplored <br>
      </p>
